<h2>Na in the light 1</h2>
<p>
  <br>The first layer is made by laser cutting and the next layer is screen printing.
  <br>Depending on where you stand, the figure of the first layer would be filled with color.
  <br>Even though Hyesok Na is receiving light and color in this piece,
  <br>there is a very visible cast shadow that symbolizes women are still in the dark.
